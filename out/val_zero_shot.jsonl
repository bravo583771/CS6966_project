defining moments occurring at sea .\nalthough the film 's rather conventional climax does n't sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two - thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception .\ndespite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely -

If it's scares you want, rent Halloween\" - The reviewer suggests that viewers should seek out other movies for their special effects or scares, rather than watching The Haunting.", "iou_f1_score": 0.19718309859154928, "token_f1_score": 0.19718309859154928}

like society where freewill does n't seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition .\nfor example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there 's no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out .\nthis angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that .\n\"\ndo we have ammunition factories ?\ndo we have food ?\ndo we have a navy ?\nall we have is tobacco .\n\"\nall true statements and yet the south still insists he 's wrong .\nbutler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it 's appealing .\nscarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her ,\nwe know he 's not going to stop until he has her .\nbut scarlett ca n't get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever .\nand so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life .\nthe conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is \" marked \" for life when her first husband dies .\nthis gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story .\nsome are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film .\nin most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance .\neven people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set .\nthe costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place .\nthe filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken .\nthe first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war .\nfleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is .\none scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , \" no ! not my leg !\ndo n't cut off my leg !\n\" another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that 's more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be .\nas the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single - handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north .\nshe manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has ca n't help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south 's ultimate defeat .\nthis brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship .\nmost of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett .\neach uses the other for personal gain , but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other .\nscarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett ca n't help but want her more every time she tries to one - up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business .\nthey say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization .\nthey need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together .\nperhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call .\nboth have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other .\nlove and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we 're left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why . gable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture .\nall ?\nnone ?\neither way is possible and it 's a mystery that can not be solved even upon repeated viewings .\nit 's safe to say most of us wo n't live such overly dramatic lives as those in \" gone with the wind , \" but it 's still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we 've just experienced a life 's worth of joy and pain .", "target": 1, "highlight": ["crowning achievement", "the costuming design is outstanding", "deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does , in such a crafted , intricate , and entertaining manner", "do have great chemistry", "still a masterpiece"], "generated_llama2": "  The movie review is positive.

comedy , \" idle hands , \" is even more of a charismatic presence here .\nthe conflicting emotions he feels for his survival , which he comes to believe he was n't meant to do , as well as the loss of the other passengers , is superbly and subtly acted on his part .\none scene , in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful .\nali larter ( 1999 's \" varsity blues \" ) , in the other central role , is also effective , as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before , leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man -- the exact opposite of her now -

minute cameo , but his appearance is rather supererogatory .\nand the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye , while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy .\nultimately , what is so good about \" final destination \" is that , within the confines of the slasher genre , writer -

director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire - fest , from dusk till dawn .\nin between , he has moonlighted as an \" actor \" with several decidedly unmemorable performances .\nnow , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown .\nand , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard 's novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed .\nfor the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie .\nthe story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double -
