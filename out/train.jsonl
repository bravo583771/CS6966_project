{"input": "when casting the key part of the voice of moses , most people 's first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer ( the saint and the island of dr .\nmoreau ) , but he was dreamworks 's choice in their first traditionally animated movie , the prince of egypt .\nthe selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one , but the biggest risk dreamworks took was n't in the casting department .\nthe radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic , a la cecil b .\ndemille , to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones .\nin the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children .\nanimated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies , now\nthat is something fresh\n.\nlet me admit up - front that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off .\ndreamworks 's antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group .\nthe prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz , but it is much more satisfying .\nlike antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixar 's a bug 's life , the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices .\ndanny glover is the voice of jethro , jeff goldblum of aaron , steve martin of hotep , helen mirren of the queen , michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah , martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti .\nyou can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god .\nthe movie , which is weakest in the story department , is a cliff 's notes version of demille 's the ten commandments .\nthe script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in moses 's life .\ndemille took over three and a half hours in order to do it justice .\nat less than half of that , the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it does n't establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters .\nwe meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket .\nwe watch him grow up and become best bud and a chariot racing partner to ramses ( ralph fiennes ) , the future pharaoh .\nmoses is a free spirit and a practical joker until he finds out his true identity as a jew .\n( \" all i 've ever known to be true is a lie , \" moses complains . )\nafter finding out his real identity , he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him .\nafter leaving egypt , moses comes back to ask ramses to let moses 's people go .\nthis leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea , which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally hand - drawn animation of the most of the production .\nit is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling .\ndrawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses , blues and golds , the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last .\nthe construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust , and other scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun .\nthe most original visual sequence in the film occurs during a dream moses\nhas .\ndone with an explicit two - dimensional look , the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story .\neven though it has its weaknesses , the prince of egypt is a noble attempt to carve out a new genre -- serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family .\nthis awe - inspiring movie deserves to be seen .\nthe prince of egypt runs about 1 : 30 .\nit is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family .\nhow old a kid would need to be to be interested depends on the child , but those over 8 will probably like it .", "target": 1, "highlight": ["the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling . drawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses , blues and golds , the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last", "a noble attempt to carve out a new genre", "proved to be a wise one", "awe - inspiring movie deserves to be seen", "it is much more satisfying", "that is something fresh", "the most original visual sequence in the film"]}
{"input": "while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks .\nand , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year .\nthe trend of the moment-- and bear in mind\nit 's a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you 've seen the animated series on hbo you 'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he 's been sent to hell .\ntodd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else .\nnot only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while .\nevery character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student .\nthe story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life .\nal simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent / assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue - in - cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him .\nthe next element in the film is the part when things go awry .\nand as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al .\nas the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene .\ninevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away .\nhence , jason 's mischievous master - mind plan , to ` conquer the world \" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil 's army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again .\nso , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife .\ntime passes .\nand now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches\nspawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . .\nthis character is merely a poor man 's obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla\n.\nnow the stage is set spawn , the new ` enemy of evil ' vs evil . and evil takes the cake , doubtlessly .\njohn leguizamo 's deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film 's relief point .\nall this anguish , pain , half - baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so - so one liners .\nand then there 's martin sheen .\nwhichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years .\nhis selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent .\nas the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b - movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot .\nthis is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street .\ni 'd never thought i 'd be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen 's career is in better shape .\nspawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable .\nfor most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes\nhis time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better .\nit constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie\n.\ncontinually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly\n, this is how pictures are being made .\nperhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry .\nthe filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible .\nthe quality of this film is abysmal and insulting .\nit is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton 's batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act .\nbut bruce wayne had human elements to him .\nhe was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human .\nthe character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he 's fatigued about being normal .\nand as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary .\nnone of this is present in spawn .\nthe fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny - dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner 's . as an example of this film 's vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic .\nadmittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that 's when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum .\nit is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature .\nbesides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn .\nmovies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to .\nand kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one .\nchildren are not muppets . and spawn unapologetically targets children .", "target": 0, "highlight": ["yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten", "seem to have forgotten every human element possible . the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting", "an insipid and wasteful one", "an odious duplicate", "lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student", "sadly", "a very bad superhero movie", "garbage", "present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest", "all this anguish , pain , half -
