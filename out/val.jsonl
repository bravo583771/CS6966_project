{"input": "when people are talking about good old times , they actually want to make some bad times look better .\nnice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s .\nfor new generations , superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids .\nfor people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for .\nfeelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era .\nmartin scorsese 's taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all .\nthe movie 's protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he ca n't sleep at nights .\nthe job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis , and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world .\nthe only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) , attractive woman working in senator palantine 's presidential campaign .\ntheir date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre .\nlosing his only link to better side of the world , travis gradually descends into psychosis , becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street .\nhe purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict .\nthat conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi .\nas many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations .\nfor some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times .\nfor others , the movie uses raskolnikov - like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade .\nbrilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides .\nhis travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence .\nhis pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain .\nhowever , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen .\nbut despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against \" scum \" is something that average person wants , but does n't have a stomach / lack of brains to do it .\nwhile de niro 's travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel .\nwizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america 's better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he \" knows stuff \" .\nhis obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade .\nother characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age .\nmatthew \" sport\n\" ( keitel , who befriended real - life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture .\nporno movies , that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom , are too much even for supposedly \" liberated \" betsy .\neven the politicians , like senator palantine , are lost in post - vietnam and post - watergate mess ; his broad and senseless \" messages \" that cover the lack of any serious program ca n't fool even such idiots like travis .\nthe past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism ca n't be washed away even by ironic happy end .\ntravis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader 's screenplay into the silver screen .\nnew york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth , and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal , almost stygian atmosphere .\nanother important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman , whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture .\none of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason .\ninstead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits , for many years it was tabloid - fodder because of hinckley and his real - life re - enactment of events in the movie .\nnow , more than two decades later , when some other \" life imitating art \" incidents get more attention , we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory .", "target": 1, "highlight": ["we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory", "uses the best of his cinematic skills", "role of a lifetime", "efficient use of jazz elements", "brilliant performance"], "generated_llama2": "  Yes, the movie review is positive.
