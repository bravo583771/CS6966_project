the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times .\nfor others , the movie uses raskolnikov - like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade .\nbrilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides .\nhis travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence .\nhis pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain .\nhowever , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen .\nbut despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against \" scum \" is something that average person wants , but does n't have a stomach / lack of brains to do it .\nwhile de niro 's travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel .\nwizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america 's better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he \" knows stuff \" .\nhis obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade .\nother characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age .\nmatthew \" sport\n\" ( keitel , who befriended real - life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ;

concept project like the truman show .\ntruman burbank ( jim carrey ) seems to have the perfect life .\nhe has a pretty , doting wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfortable insurance sales position , an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven , a reliable childhood buddy marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia , this is paradise .\nor so it would seem .\nbizarre , inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in truman 's life .\na lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky .\na rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term ' isolated ' follows him around .\na radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move .\nfor the first time in his life , it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be .\nthe truman show , directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remarkably well - constructed film , paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next .\nbalancing drama with humour , thoughtfulness with abandon , this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy .\nin many ways , mr .\nniccol 's screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca\n-- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character - defining moments occurring at sea .\nalthough the film 's rather conventional climax does n't sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two - thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception .\ndespite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely - crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible .\nthe tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully - stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false .\nthe end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable , crowdpleasing underdog vs .\nthe system formula .\nwhile the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept , some elements are lacking .\nthe device of mysterious lauren / sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman 's growing awareness is n't exactly convincing .\nthere 's not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film .\nin fact , although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman 's artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers , it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even * more * deeply in the insulatory seahaven world , with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling .\nstill , the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target , and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti - voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city .\ni 've always believed that the versatile ms .\nlinney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character , mischievously flashing a glazed , insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans .\ncheerfully going over the top , it 's hilarious to watch her -- who would have ever guessed that she 'd have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ?\nms .\nlinney is a delight in the film .\nbut it is mr .\ncarrey who rules the show here\n.\nhe may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal :\nit 's difficult not to root for truman .\nin a commanding performance , mr .\ncarrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence , and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn , demonstrating admirable restraint -- there 's an early scene where he 's down on his knees gardening , and given his past track record , one almost instinctively anticipates mr .\ncarrey to pull one of more infamous , and in this case , wholly inappropriate sight gags .\nit 's almost poetic how this notorious look - at - me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who 's constantly the centre of attention .\nin addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr .\nemmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman 's antiseptic , white picket - fenced smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz 's original score .\ntechnical credits are first - rate all around .\nwhile the truman show is clearly a definitive high - concept film , it 's not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one -- obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound , ranging from 1965 's secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner .\nall the same , this is a visionary , award -

up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business .\nthey say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization .\nthey need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together .\nperhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call .\nboth have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other .\nlove and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we 're left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why . gable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture .\nall ?\nnone ?\neither way is possible and it 's a mystery that can not be solved even upon repeated viewings .\nit 's safe to say most of us wo n't live such overly dramatic lives as those in \" gone with the wind , \" but it 's still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we 've just experienced a life 's worth of joy and pain .", "target": 1, "highlight": ["crowning achievement", "the costuming design is outstanding", "deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does , in such a crafted , intricate , and entertaining manner", "do have great chemistry", "still a masterpiece"], "generated_llama2": "The movie review is positive.

he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza .\nthe film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur .\nthe movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action .\nin fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it does n't present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together .\nrather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on .\nthe film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta 's history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city 's oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr .\nmartin luther king , jr .\nthe story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway .\nthe insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur .\nfreeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke .\nthe film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger .\ndriving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it 's about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon .\ndaisy is strong - willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur .\ninitially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere .\nonce she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back - seat driver .\nto make matters worse , she is extremely self - conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand .\neventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke 's good - natured charm and infectious cheer ;

{"input": "i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of \" good will hunting \" , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein - level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight .\nthe only problem is that will is a tough street kid who 's had his share of run - ins with the law , and before long he 's being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight .\nprofessor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions .\nthis sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but \" good will hunting \" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama .\na conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will 's therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting .\nwill finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau 's attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle .\nhe also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her .\nwhat makes \" good will hunting \" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will 's life .\nthe script 's sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong .\nlambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we 're not sure if we like what he has to say .\nand sean , for all his warm - heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will .\nwill 's reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters ' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious \" right \" and \" wrong \" side and beating them over the head with it .\nfor a film with such an extraordinary character , \" good will hunting \" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another .\nthis film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far - fetched situation .\n\"\ngood will hunting\n\" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture .\nand in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa .\nwill 's relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100 +\nuses of the ' f ' word , which was most likely the reason for its r - rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will 's character .\nadd all this to the fact that \" good will hunting \" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i have n't given this film four stars .\nwell , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original .\nthere are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions .\nstill , \" good will hunting \" takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definitely one of the better personal dramas\ni have seen in the last few years , and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of ' 97 films .", "target": 1, "highlight": ["rather amusing", "has its share of fun humor", "work so well , aside from the strong performances", "depth of characterization", "a poignant and clever drama", "one of the top five", "one of the better personal dramas"], "generated_llama2": "The movie review is positive.

your - face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent .\nthe mostly - straightforward chronology of jackie brown does n't match up favorably to the non - linear style of tarantino 's previous efforts ?\nan approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives .\nand there are n't nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around .\nthere 's a samuel l .\njackson monologue about guns , a jackson / chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson / robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson / travolta material from pulp fiction , but that 's about it .\njackie brown 's lone \" innovation \" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives .\nthis is n't exactly an original technique ?\nit has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa 's rashomon and most recently in edward zwick 's courage under fire .\nhowever , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points - of- view , tarantino 's sole purpose for using it\nappears to be because it 's unconventional .\nhad the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost .\nas a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity .\nfor the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a ' 70s icon .\nthis time around , instead of john travolta , it 's blaxploitation queen pam grier\n( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) .\nin one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier 's career , tarantino uses a ' 70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits .\nthere are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt - kicking ) .\ngrier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states .\nshe 's working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official .\nno longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv 's \" banyon \" ) to post the necessary $ 10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal .\njackie passes ordell 's test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $ 500 , 000 of ordell 's money into the united states without tipping off the feds .\nsoon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell 's perpetually oversexed and drugged - out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right - hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) .\nunsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell is n't nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction .\nin addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) .\nrobert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough - guys - who - rarely- smile roles .\nbridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino 's foot fetish .\nrobert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle - aged actor .\nthe film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two - and - a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) .\ntarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself .\nwhen it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second - tier effort .\nit 's an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender .", "target": 1, "highlight": ["in addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good", "it 's an entertaining diversion", "offers solid entertainment", "keeps things moving along nicely"], "generated_llama2": "The movie review is mixed, with both positive and negative comments.\n\nPositive comments:\n\n* The reviewer praises the film's \"solid entertainment\" and \"witty dialogue\"\n* They note that Pam Grier is \"quite good\" and \"looks fantastic\"\n* The reviewer compliments Samuel L.

{"input": "one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable .\nyou know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is .\nsure , it 's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch .\nthis cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun .\none of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story .\nthis rule applies highly to kiss the girls .\nthere is something psychologically stimulating in a well - crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made .\nhowever , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through .\nwell , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up .\nunfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits .\nthat may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery .\nhowever , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film .\nplotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality .\nwe are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero .\nhe gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself .\nobviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene .\nat his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days .\nthis provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we ca n't sympathize with detective cross .\nhowever , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees .\n. .\nbefore she is abducted .\ndr .\nkate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family )\nis a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova -- what the serial killer likes to call himself .\nbecause of these character - developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful .\nafter being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods .\nremembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out .\nwhen casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall .\nafter she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice .\nfrom this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive .\nmany people will compare this film to 1995 's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional .\nthe screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i do n't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form .\nwhat makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness .\nthe cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us .\nsometimes a simple shot is the best one . however , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight .\nthe scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way .\nthe camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well .\nthe chaotic and mtv - type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd 's character is experiencing .\nhowever , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors .\nmorgan freeman is one of today 's most powerful and believable actors .\ndetective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven .\nbecause of freeman 's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself .\nthe other half is carried by ashley judd ,\none of today 's most promising dramatic actresses .\nin fact , her performance is better than freeman 's , if that is even possible .\nher character is more original than freeman 's , and she handles it wonderfully .\nwe finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream .\nthe supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it .\ncary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character .\ntony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but\nwe do n't really get to know his character either .\ngina ravera gives a good performance , but again she is n't in many of the scenes .\nso as a result of all these small supporting parts , the weight of the film lies on the two leads , and they do a phenomenal job .\nsome of the best acting of this genre , and some of the best acting of the year .\ntwo other essential aspects of the film are quite good .\ndirector gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors , but the second half of the film loses believability , especially during the revelation of the killer .\nhe also does n't handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have , losing a lot of tension during many scenes . however , to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half .\npart of the blame falls on david klass .\ni 'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more , but klass focuses on the two main parts .\nwhile this may give the two leads more screentime , many of the small characters are one - dimensional , and the killer , when revealed , is extremely implausible .\nthanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel , kiss the girls\nalways seems intelligent .\nnone of the conversations are laughable , and all move the plot forward without seeming forced .\none of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer .\ni blame this mainly on the casting director , because the killer 's motive is because of rejection from women ( or so i assume from the opening monologue ) , but the killer himself is very attractive ( one of my friends is a , shall we say , big admirer of the killer ) .\nkiss the girls is rated r for terror , violence , language , and suggested sex .\nwith all the implausibilities of this film , and with the mediocre second half , kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain\n.\nin fact , i had the urge to see it again just for the performances .\nthe cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone , and the script is usually smart .\nthis is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through .\nmorgan freeman is possibly today 's most convincing actor , and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt .\ni must also say that i loved the ending .\nthe showdown between good and evil was quite tense , and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer .\nperhaps it may not be possible , but most of the film is n't anyway .", "target": 1, "highlight": ["today 's most convincing actor", "i loved the ending", "does a good job", "she handles it wonderfully", "always seems intelligent", "what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness", "terrific", "one of today 's most promising dramatic actresses", "extremely well done", "to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half", "many of the shots are stunning", "manages to thoroughly entertain", "certainly well made", "one of today 's most powerful and believable actors"], "generated_llama2": "The movie review is generally positive, with the reviewer praising the performances of the leads, Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd, and the technical and visual aspects of the film.

not to mention one of the best films of the year .\nwhat gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom 's 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what 's on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences .\nthe bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but\nthose who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow - mindedness .\nchocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion .\nthe bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non - religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth - watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens .\nmany are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne 's opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon - like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business .\non the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne 's shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent - koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie - ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does .\nalso a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends .\njuliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne ,\ngenuinely capturing her character 's determination to turn the narrow - minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat 's success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses .\nlena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs .\njudi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin .\ncarrie ann - moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously .\nvictoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always - on - the - move mother will eventually settle down .\na trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : \" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie .\n\"\nthat 's not to say the men do n't do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne .\nthe technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board\n: lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film .\ncinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and\nrachel portman 's masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules .\nchocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter .\nwhile not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom 's chocolat is a film which works on all levels -
